    # Note: ALB, ECS, and CloudFront requiring outputs from previous stacks would typically use a script or proper stack nesting/exports.
    # For this simplified workflow, we are deploying the base layers. 
    # Validating complex dependencies often requires a more orchestrated approach (e.g. CDK or a script).
